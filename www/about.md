Thanks for visiting! My name is Andrew Luitink, I am a software development professional and a technology enthusiast. I live and breath for technology and love inventing.

My favorite language is C# and I have spent the last five years developing software in the Microsoft realm. I see the .NET Framework as the next step in the evolution of cross platform development.

On the cold and rainy days, I enjoy writing software, doing live development webcasts, and watching Netflix. On the nicer days I try to stay active with hiking, biking, running, and exploring.

I have a two year old Boxer named Kate, she keeps me active even on the days I want to be lazy.

Special thanks to:

MaterializeCSS, Skrollr, Scrolline.js, Jekyll

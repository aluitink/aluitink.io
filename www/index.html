						<h4>C:\Users\Andrew>whoami</h4>
					</div>
					Thanks for visiting! My name is Andrew Luitink, I am a software development professional and a technology enthusiast. I live and breath for technology and love inventing.
					<br>
					<br>
					My favorite language is C# and I have spent the last five years developing software in the Microsoft realm. I see the .NET Framework as the next step in the evolution of cross platform development.
					<br>
					<br>
					On the cold and rainy days, I enjoy writing software, doing live development webcasts, and watching Netflix. On the nicer days I try to stay active with hiking, biking, running, and exploring.
					<br>
					<br>
					I have a two year old Boxer named Kate, she keeps me active even on the days I want to be lazy.
					<br>
					This site is still being built, check back for more later.

								<h4>c-sharp</h4>
								I have been designing and developing enterprise class applications in C#/.NET for the past 5 years. During my time with Quest/Dell I took part in all aspects of the application lifecycle, from planning and design, development and testing, to release and maintenance. We practiced Agile development using a loose Scrum process. I worked with our remote development team in China and helped coordinate releases on time.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text darken-1 waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>iis</h4>
								The Archive Manager product hosts an ASP.NET website to facilitate e-discovery searching and archive management. I have experience building IIS applications, sharing cookies across virtual application, troubleshooting application dependency issues, and programmatic IIS configuration.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>ms-sql</h4>
								Microsoft SQL Server is the primary storage container for Archive Manager. E-Mail messages are normalized and the various parts are stored. A flattened linked list is used for directory hierarchy. I've designed stored procedures using standard T-SQL as well as Dynamic SQL. When troubleshooting performance issues in customer environments, I had needed to mock the execution and generate execution plans to determine performance bottlenecks.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>active-directory</h4>
								Building development and QA labs allowed me to play sys-admin many times. I've built many Active Directory deployments including, single domain, multiple domain, child-parent domains, multiple forest, user/resource forest. Archive Manager supports Exchange environments so we needed every conceivable Active Directory configuration possible for research and testing. I have developed applications that can query and filter Active Directory and understand how to use the directory services utilities as well as how to interact using standard LDAP/LDAPS.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>groupwise</h4>
								The GroupWise Type Library is a COM callable library that I have used to access post offices and mailbox data from GroupWise. We created a COM Object Wrapper to manage reference counting and ensure proper disposing of COM objects. Before we had a COW, we had many issues with access violations and handle leaks.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text darken-1 waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>java-script</h4>
								Web everything is the future for end users. Rich responsive websites built using frameworks like AngularJS and React will change the way people experience the Internet. Dell's Common UI library is written in AngularJS and Sass, I have used these and other open source libraries to build projects and proof of concepts.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>power-shell</h4>
								PowerShell is an great tool, I've developed many scripts we have used in customer environments for data recovery and system configuration. One of the new technologies that seems useful is Desired State Configuration, a declarative method for configuring Windows machines via PowerShell. I have some experience writing PowerShell modules in C#, we had been in talks about building a PowerShell wrapper around our SDK to make testing easier for the QA and Automation teams.

								Windows Server has been my home for the past 5 years, from 2003 to 2012 R2, I have experience implementing servers in various roles and maintaining the deployments.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text darken-1 waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>exchange</h4>
								I have built, managed, and maintained Exchange Server deployments used in development and testing. I have experience with MAPI, both implementation and troubleshooting, and I have a strong understanding of the MAPI architecture.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>e-directory</h4>
								Novell e-Directory is going to be my least favorite, I was generally fascinated by e-Directory in my earlier years, but as I was faced with more issues and very obscure help, I started to feel like e-Directory was an antiquated system. Unfortunantly I was still required to support our softwares integration with the platform. I have experience using the Novell Admin libraries, we used them to enumerate users from the directory and discover other environmental information required for archiving GroupWise mailboxes.

							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text darken-1 waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>linux</h4>
								Linux brings out the hacker in me, I have always loved problem solving in Linux. From my first attempts at building a software package from source without glibc .. then realizing there are Package Managers, to my hobby builds of Gentoo, seeing how small I can get the Kernel and how fast I can boot a machine. I love the versatility of Linux and I love the challenge of putting Linux on everything.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>virtualization</h4>
								VMWare Workstation, ESXi, Hyper-V, OpenBox. Virtualization is a powerful tool and a developer that understands how to use this tool will work faster and smarter and bother your IS team far less. I inherited an ESXi server from my predecessor and loved the memory management but disliked the lack of linked clones. I also found that if you make a backup of a disk file, it expands the disk file and can cost you hundreds of gigabytes in whitespace. I took it upon myself to remedy these issues by creating a script to generate linked clones by manually editing VMDK and VMX files, then I built a nightly rolling backup agent that uses a statically linked version of rsync and hardlinks to create very efficient nightly full backups. The system has been stable for 4 years.
							</li>
							<li class="card advantage {{site.css}} white-text darken-1 waves-effect waves-light">
								<h4>containerization</h4>
								I'm not sure if containerization is a real word, but I have heard it used a lot. Docker seems to be the future! This website is hosted in a Docker container, on Linux virtual machines, in my home office.
								I was able to build this website without having to understand the various technologies that the template is built from. Deploy, Test, Change, Retest.

								<h4>Dell Software Group</h4>
								<h6>INTL PROD SUPT ENG II SR ANLYST (SEPTEMBER 2012 - OCTOBER 2015)</h6>
								<p>
								Quest Software soon became Dell Software Group when it was acquired by Dell Computers. Their venture into the software world brought many new experiences.
								After becoming DSG, the Archive Manager product needed a new face. Rebranding a product is not always fun, but this gave me a chance to experiment and learn.
								The product made a large jump from Version 4.8 to 5.0, this major version change included a new installer using the Wix Toolset and a new configuration utility based on the Dell Clarity branding guidelines.
								</p>
								<p>
								I was given the research task of designing a WinForms UI library that can be used cross product and adheres to the branding guidelines we received from Dell proper.
								I had very little experience designing UI, but I was able to build a reusable library of controls that looked very similar to those being built for the web.
								Along with the control library, I designed a configuration wizard that follows the MVC pattern. This design pattern separated the UI from the business logic, allowing for easy replacement in the future.
								</p>
								<p>
								The library was picked up by a few other product teams and used as a quick way to do configuration rebranding since no one else in the company was exploring this. 
								I think it was used by three or four other products and also used in experimental projects by groups of interns.
								</p>
								<p>
								These past years with Dell have been great, I have had the chance to get involved in a number of Common Engineering initiatives and lent my spare time to many side projects.

								<h4>Quest Software</h4>
								<h6>DEVELOPMENT ESCALATIONS ENGINEER (JULY 2010 - SEPTEMBER 2012)</h6>
								<p>
								During my time with Quest Software I worked on an e-mail archiving/e-discovery product called Archive Manager. The primary target market was Microsoft Exchange but it also support Novell GroupWise.
								While supporting and developing for Archive Manager I gained experience with development and management for Active Directory/AD-LDS/e-Directory, Exchange/GroupWise, SQL Server, IIS, and Azure.
								My role was primarily product support but I also picked up a partial development role providing bug fixes and workarounds for product issues to customers.
								</p>
								I really enjoyed engaging with customers and helping resolve their issues. My primary responsibilities were product support but my interest in the product and willingness to take on more work allowed me to get my first real taste of professional software development.

								<h4>iNOC</h4>
								<h6>SERVICE DESK ENGINEER (FEBUARY 2008 - JULY 2010)</h6>
								<p>
								While still attending my last year of school, I landed a job with a local company that provided outsourced Network Operations services. iNOC's network monitoring platform was built in house, primarily by a single developer.
								My duties with iNOC included, responding to network/service outages, reporting downed circuits, configuring devices, and other general troubleshooting. As a Linux shop, I loved how much I could customize and automate various aspects of my job.
								One of the duties I disliked the most was a weekly check of all of the remote access POTS lines for the various collection agents at customer sites. Nothing is worse than dialing into a remote device and navigating through those dreadful remote management systems. 
								Around the fourth time I had to do this I started to wonder why this couldn't be automated. The development team had much better things to worry about so I scripted the process and built templates for the various remote systems.
								Now once a week I could run these checks in the background, this freed up my time to handle customer issues and deal with the critical stuff.
								</p>
								<p>
								</p>
								I learned quite a bit about architecting a large distributed network and various high availability and clustering services for Linux. I am very big into the Windows world today, but I will always love Linux and will usually prefer it as a service platform over Windows, you can't beat free.

				I love to invent, design, and build. Nothing excites me more that dreaming up a new idea and trying to build it. I have had many projects in the past, some I have finished, some I have abandoned. I feel the main goal is not always to finish something, but to learn something.
				Each invention I have, I draw from previous experiences to try and build a better pattern. I have not always been good about maintaining these inventions in source control. I'm in the process of getting my work placed in repositories, here is what I have currently available.

					<p>
					I've been dreaming this one up for a while. Ojibwe is the first step in a two part project that's goal is to provide a powerful encrypted cloud storage solution that is scalable.
					The project uses both symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption to provide fast and secure cloud blob storage. This solution only puts encrypted bytes over the wire. An implementer will use the SDK to create containers and blobs.
					When a blob is stored, a random symmetrical key is created, the data is encrypted, the key is then encrypted with the users public key and stored in the key storage database. The blob is then uploaded and stored on the servers file system or in AmazonS3.
					The SDK has interfaces for new Storage Adapters and Data Access (schema, key, and blob storage system).
					Blobs can be shared, keys are shared by re-encrypting them with destination users public key.
					</p>
					<p>
					Navajo - Phase 2, includes layering Document Storage and indexing on top of this to allow for more interesting applications to be developed. I imagine a social network where the network provider has no visibility into users information, and a user could sell their info to the network for a fee.

					During my time with Quest/Dell Software, we had a yearly 24 hour hackathon. Teams would design an idea and they would have 24 hours to build it before they had to demonstrate the functionality.
					Hawkeye uses SharpPcap, a network traffic capture library that wraps WinPcap (similar to Wireshark), to collect network packet information. I incorporated it into an open source Dell Software solution called Doradus, a big data analytics platform on top of Apache Cassandra.
					The application uses an OLAP database to perform aggregation queries on packet information from billions of packets.
					Having only 24 hours, the majority of the time was writing a client library for Doradus in C#.
					I worked alone on this one and took home the Directors Choice award for this one as it utilized the a Common Engineering component.

					I have always been interested in machine learning and AI. I developed my own Back Propgation Neural Network for experimenting, in hopes that some day I would be able to use it in a project. I have not come up with anything useful yet, but it did lead me to experiment with Convolution Nerual Networks for facial recognition.

					Lucene is an open source indexing engine by Apache. I've used Lucene before in product development and thought that it would make a very fast and light weight object store for primitive models. I created a wrapper around Lucene that serializes POCO objects and indexes the properties to make them searchable. I've used it in a few applications, very useful for quick and dirty object store. Capable of hosting hundreds of millions of records.

					<p>
					This idea started as a simple two dimensional game of life style web game. The project was scrapped because of complexities associated with trying to make it a three dimensional game and I sort of lost interest.
					</p>
					<p>
					The initial version placed a players character on a game board and provided a scripting area. The end user could script their characters logic using a primitive JavaScript API that on the client side was executed and caused a SignalR WebSockets call to be made to the server, resulting in a characters movement.
					The player was able to control the character movements by telling the server, the server would then update all players with new information. The idea was exciting, but mostly an exercise in understanding SignalR and WebSockets.

                    <p>
					While working for Dell Software, an internal development group was created to deal with common engineering efforts that would be used on all products. Their flagship product is a set of web controls written in AngluarJS for a Common User Interface.
					This user interface matched the Dell styling guidelines perfectly and would be adopted by all applications that have a web front end.
					</p>
					<p>
					While our product had a web front end, it also had a thick client backend responsible for server configuration and things of that nature. Everyone wanted to use the common UI controls as they were tested and developed by another team, but we still had the requirements of interacting with the host operating system.
					</p>
					<p>
					I took a look into OWIN, a set of libraries that are compatible with much of ASP.NET MVC and build a web hosting application that used SignalR for JavaScript to .NET Remoting and WebAPI 2 as a more standard REST interface.
					This way we could build a rich server tool that can break out of the JavaScript web browser sandbox and interact with the machine it is running on.

					<p>
					My work on the Archive Manager product gave me a lot of experience with Microsoft's Mail API (MAPI). MAPI is an interesting library because of how it provides data to you.
					MAPI is a collection of native interfaces that you can query to access mail on an Exchange system.
					</p>
					<p>
					There are various flavors of MAPI, but they are more or less called the same. The client side of the connection allows you to talk to a MAPI Store Provider and communicate with something on the other end.
					There is a managed client implementation called MAPI33 that seems to have been removed from the Internet. This allowed the query of the MAPI subsystem from Managed code. The only missing part was a MAPI provider implementation that allows you to create a provider for MAPI.
					</p>
					<p>
					We had this idea of allowing users to access their Archived Email directly from Outlook without needing to write an Outlook Add-in. If we had a MAPI provider, we could simply add it to the users mail profile and let Outlook display it all.
					</p>
					<p>
					Our local MAPI expert wrote most of the ground work, dealing with all of the marshalling from Native to Managed code. I started work on the Managed provider implementation and the Native facade used to invoke the managed implementation.
					We never officially released this but it was a great learning experience on how to invoke Managed code via COM from unmanaged code.

					It had no practical use, but in the end it was able to pull images and HTML pages from an HTTP stream.

					<p>
					During my time at iNOC, I was really interested in Network Monitoring the idea of building a monitoring system that is modular and fast. For some reason I wrote this entire application in PHP. Yes the entire thing was PHP, even the backend code that does the monitoring. 
					I used a standard LAMP stack and write an application that could monitor and report network outages using very common tools like Ping and SNMP. Since my degree is in computer networking, I had a small Cisco lab in my basement that I used for testing. I could alert on interfaces being down or unreachable, unauthorized login attempts, and standard ping monitoring.
					</p>
					<p>
					The platform was interesting, but not very scalable, the lack of threading support lead me to build my own multi-threading library that essentially launches a bunch of child processes to perform the work.

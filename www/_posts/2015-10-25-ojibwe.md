I would like to talk about the first project on my list.

Ojibwe is a project I have been slowly working on for the past few months. I recently checked it into GitHub and made it open source.

The project has moved from an ASP.NET 4 WebAPI 2 application to an ASP.NET 5 MVC 6 application.

Since I heard about ASP.NET 5, I have been very excited. With the launch of Visual Studio 2015, [ASP.NET 5](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html) will build projects that are cross platform and can be executed using [.NET Execution Environment (DNX)](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx).

So what is DNX and why is it so cool?

DNX is cross platform, Windows/Linux/Mac, and allows you to run your ASP.NET applications on any of these platforms.

It sits on top of [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) which has already built the foundation for .NET on Linux and Mac.

I'm still a bit new with DNX, I am still discovering new stuff each day, so I don't have all of the answers. But what this means for me, a .NET Developer, is that I can now build all of these wonderful micro services and run them in Linux.

To make development and portability easy, I run my applications in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

Now my application can be built and deployed in a matter of minutes, without having to worry about configuring an environment or having the right dependencies.

Once the container is built, the image is reusable and will always work.

So what is Ojibwe?

Ojibwe is my first conceptual design of a very secure Encrypted Storage Abstraction Layer. It is far from being complete as I'm discovering new bugs every day, but it is a working proof of concept.

I came up with the idea when Facebook started to get a lot of bad PR over how they use "Your Data", I'm not even sure why they call it "Your Data" when, by uploading pictures and posting content, you are giving that data to Facebook. I wanted to bring back the idea of "Your Data" and privacy.

Today, if you make a private post on Facebook about a death in your family or some other issue that, is meant for you and your friends only. Other people might not be able to see it, but Facebook still can. I'm not saying there is some guy at Facebook trying to read all of your posts, but the data is there for them to view if they so choose to.

The data is there if they choose to run an analytics application across the dataset to mine for keywords, for advertising.

Wouldn't it be a little creepy if you posted about your mother dying and Facebook ads started showing you Mother's day advertising. (An odd example.. I know).

My point is, that I wanted to create a system that will be the new platform for privacy on the Internet. Content is only visible by those you share it with. If the content provider wants your personal information, you can sell it to them rather than simply giving it to them.

What kind of person would implement such a restrictive system if they cannot get money from it? Well, I'm not sure yet.. but the platform will be here when you are ready.

Ojibwe is a fact finding mission, determine if I can store encrypted blobs and retreive them, while supporting a meta data system.

Currently you can create Containers, store Blobs in the Containers, set Key-Value pairs on the Blobs, and Share the Blobs with other users.

The encryption is all client side, only encrypted data goes over the wire.

When a Blob is being stored, we generate a random symmetrical and use that to encrypt the blob data, we then encrypt the symmetrical key with our asymmetrical public key, this means that the Blob's symmetrical key can only be decrypted by the users asymmetrical private key.

Once the Blob and it's symmetrical key are encrypted, we transfer the encrypted symmetrical key to the online keychain and then transfer the encrypted Blob data to the storage sub-system.

We set some linkages in the schema and return a copy of the Blob to the user.

The system sits on top of a Cassandra database, it is one of the fastest and most scalable NoSQL database. The REST API can sit behind an Nginx reverse proxy for load balancing.

When we need more power, add a few more API instances, if key storage becomes slow, add a few more Cassandra instances. It should really be that easy to scale out.

I'll be building more into this as time goes by, today I connected it to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration.

Currently the build is [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aluitink/Ojibwe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aluitink/Ojibwe)

I also have Docker containers that you can use to test/demo.

So this morning my hosting provider (Me) decided that because I was up early, I should apply server updates and reboot my virtual host. This happens to be the first time Microsoft Updates had failed on me.

Here I am having just sent out a number of resumes with this site attached to it and I go way past my 30 minute maintenance window. It would seem that I should probably get my environment move into the cloud.

It looks like everything is back up so I'm hoping no one noticed :) but if you did, my sincere apologies.

Hello there, thanks for dropping by and welcome!

I started this site a few days back as a living portfolio of my interests and work. I have always wanted to make something like this but I have never had the time.

If you don't know me and would like to know a little more about the most recent things happening in my life, the blog will contain news and updates.

This site is hosted on Jekyll, and this is my first experience with a static content blog system like this so things are starting out pretty slow.

On to the next post!

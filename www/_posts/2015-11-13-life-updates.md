It has been a while since I last posted. I have been very busy these past weeks. Carly and I are planning on moving to Colorado in December. We found a really nice place in a new area of Colorado Springs and signed our lease yesterday.

We are both very excited for this move, but it is also very stressful trying to plan everything. I own a home here in Wisconsin and instead of trying to sell it, we are going to try and rent it for a year or two, maybe longer if everything goes well.

While out in Colorado, looking for homes, I was also looking for jobs, both around the area and remote. I recently accepted a position with Binary Tree, they are a data migration company that does almost the same stuff I was doing with Quest/Dell Software.

The position is in product support and although product support is hardly what I want to be doing at this point in my life, I find that the support team takes a lot of pride in their jobs and the people seem very driven and proud of what they do. Although I would rather be doing software development, this company seems to value their support engineer and that is really all I am looking for.

While working support for Quest/Dell, I went way beyond what I was expected to do, which was essentially determine the severity of the issue, file a BugID, triage and follow up. At the end of my time with them, I had about the same understanding of the code base as anyone else on the team. I was able to find the bug in the code, write a fix, check it in, build and package the patch, QA it, and provide it to the customer.

This work flow, having a development resource on your support team, cut out all interactions the Developers had with the end users. I feel that if one of their problems is the amount of time spent by developers diagnosing bugs, then I will be a great asset.

So with this new job comes a bunch of new perks. I work from home, something I have always been interested in as I love the solitude. My new health insurance has zero employee contribution (unless I'm covering other family members). My Internet and cell phone are paid for! And I get a fairly substantial pay raise from my last job.

The timing for this .. could have been a little better, but Dell wanted to close our office and they wanted to do it quickly. I took the change as an opportunity to change my life completely. With the severance I get, I am now able to afford the cross country move that we had been planning for 5 years into our future.

All in all, this is something we both want to do. Our parents/family all loved the idea, but now that the move is getting closer it seems they really don't want us to go.

This will be a change for the better, our new 5 year plan is to buy or build a house in the mountains!
